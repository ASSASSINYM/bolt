# Programs Test Suite

These **.bolt** programs are used for expectation tests - they're named after the behaviour they are testing.

There are both positive and negative examples - the positive examples being put in good/ and then the negative examples placed in bad_parse/ bad_type_check data_races/ based on which stage of the parsing/type-checking pipeline they fail.
